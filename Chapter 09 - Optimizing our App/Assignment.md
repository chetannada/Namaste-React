## Namaste React Course by Akshay Saini
# Chapter 09 - Optimizing our App


## Theory Assignment:
- When and why do we need `lazy()`?
- What is `suspense`?
- Why we got this `error`: A component was suspended while responding to `synchronous input`. This will cause the `UI` to be replaced with a `loading indicator`. To `fix this`, `updates that suspend` should be wrapped with `start transition`? How does `suspense fix` this error?
- `Advantages and Disadvantages` of using this `code splitting pattern`?
- `When` do we and `why do we need suspense`?


## Coding Assignment:
- Create your `custom hooks`.
- Try out `lazy and suspense`
- Make your `code clean`.
