## Coding Assignment:
- Create `Class Based` Component.
    - Create 2 `class-based child components`.
    - `Pass props` from `Parent to child`.
    - Create a `constructor`.
    - Create a `state variable` inside child.
    - Use `this.setState` to update it.
    - What if there are `multiple state variables`?
    - Write a `console.log` for each lifecycle method.
    - Play with the `console logs` to find out the correct order of their execution.
