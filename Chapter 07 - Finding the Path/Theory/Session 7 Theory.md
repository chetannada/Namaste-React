## Q: What are various ways to `add images` into our App? Explain with `code examples`.
A: Using the `full URL of the image` for the web (CDN) or any public images.
Example : 
```
<img src="https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png" alt="React Image" />
```
Adding the image into the project 
`Drag your image into your project` and `import it` into the desired component
```
import reactLogo from "./reactLogo.png";
export default function App() {
  return <img src={reactLogo} alt="react logo" />
}
```
The correct way to structure images in your project is to add them in an `images` folder. If you are using other `assets` than just images, you might want to add all in the `assets` folders. 
```
import reactLogo from "../../assets/images/reactLogo.png";
export default function App() {
  return <img src={reactLogo} alt="react logo" />
}
```


## Q: What would happen if we do `console.log(useState())`?
A: If we do `console.log(useState())`, we get an array `[undefined, function]`  where first item in an array is `state` is `undefined` and the second item in an array is `setState` `function` is bound dispatchSetState.


## Q: How will `useEffect` behave if we `don't add` a `dependency array`?
A: Syntax of `useEffect` is:
```
useEffect(() => {}, []);
```
Case 1 : When the `dependency array is not included` in the arguments of `useEffect() hook`, the callback function will be executed `every time` the component is rendered and re-rendered.
```
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I run everytime this component rerenders")
});
```
Case 2 : When the `dependency array is empty` in the arguments of `useEffect() hook`, the callback function will be executed `only one time` during the initial render of the component.
```
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I Only run once (When the component gets mounted)")
}, []);
```
Case 3 :  When the `dependency array contains a condition`,  the callback function will be executed  `one time` during the initial render of the component and also rerender if there is a `change in the condition`.
```
useEffect(() => {
	console.log("I run every-time when my condition changed")
}, [condition]);
```


## Q: What is `SPA`?
A: `Single Page Application (SPA)` is a web application that dynamically updates the webpage with data from web server without reloading/refreshing the entire page. All the HTML, CSS, JS are retrieved in the initial load and other data/resources can be loaded dynamically whenever required. An SPA is sometimes referred to as a `single-page interface (SPI)`.


## Q: What is the difference between `Client Side Routing` and `Server Side Routing`?
A: In `Server-side routing or rendering (SSR)`, every change in URL, http request is made to server to fetch the webpage, and replace the current webpage with the older one. 

In `Client-side routing or rendering (CSR)`, during the first load, the webapp is loaded from server to client, after which whenever there is a change in URL, the router library navigates the user to the new page without sending any request to backend. All `Single Page Applications uses client-side routing`.
